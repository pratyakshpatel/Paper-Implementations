We've all learnt and implemented random forest; it's one of the first algorithms we encounter in ML. Most of the time, we strive to find patterns using such algorithms. Another paradigm is anomaly detection — and that’s how I came across Isolation Forests. In this project, I wrote the full Isolation Forest algorithm from scratch using NumPy. The model builds binary trees by recursively splitting randomly sampled data to isolate outliers quickly. I used synthetic 2D data (normal + uniform noise), calculated anomaly scores based on average path lengths, and visualized the decision boundaries.
